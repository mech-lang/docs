Identifiers
============

Identifiers in Mech are used to name tables, functions, machines, and other elements in Mech programs. They follow specific rules to ensure they can be parsed correctly by Mech.

Rules for Mech Identifiers
----------------------------

- Identifiers must begin with an alphabetic character or equivalent unicode character.

- They cannot begin with a number or an underscore.

- Identifiers can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and slashes. No other characters are allowed.

- Spaces are not allowed in identifiers; kebab case (where a dash is used between words) is the preferred naming convention for identifiers. 

Some examples of valid identifiers:

  speed
  time
  object-position
  diameter-in-cm
  math/sin

Examples of invalid Mech Identifiers

  1speed
  _time
  object position
  color%

In general, it is recommended to keep identifiers simple, clear, and meaningful. Using kebab case can make identifiers more readable and easier to understand, especially for longer names.

Unicode Ecoding
-----------------

Mech supports Unicode character encodings. Here are some examples of valid Mech identifiers containing Unicode:

  Î»xx   -- an identifier which contains a Greek character
  æ—¥æœ¬èªž -- an identifier in Japanese characters
  ðŸ’»    -- an identifier that is just a computer emoji
  âˆ‘i    -- an identifier for a summation with a sigma symbol
