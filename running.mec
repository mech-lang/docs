Running Mech
-------------

Start the REPL by invoking the command "mech" in a console. This will drop you into a prompt (pictured above). Right now you can load a program from disk, inspect the core and runtime, and perform calculations. Type ":help" in the REPL to see a full list of commands, or run the REPL with the -h flag to see a full list of supported options.
