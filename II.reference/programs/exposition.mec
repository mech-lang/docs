Exploratory and Expository Programming
========================================

Mech is especially well suited for exploratory and expository porgramming modes. Exploratory programming is the practice of using a programming language to explore a design or solution space. Expository programming is the practice of using a programming language to explain a topic. These two modes of programming are in contrast to applications or systems programming, where the goal is to build an application or a system. Most languages to date have been specifically built for applications and systems programming, but Mech is designed with exploratory and expository programming in mind. In this section, we'll look at how the features of Mech are especially well suited for these programming modes.

Introduction
--------------

Exploratory programming involves using a programming language to investigate design concepts or potential solutions, allowing developers to iterate quickly and test hypotheses in real-time. It encourages creativity and discovery through rapid prototyping, trial and error, and interactive adjustments. In contrast, expository programming uses programming languages to explain, teach, or document a specific concept or topic. It emphasizes readability, clarity, and conveying complex ideas understandably, often employing illustrative examples, interactive demonstrations, and well-structured code as learning resources.

These modes differ from applications and systems programming, which focus on building functional software applications or systems. While the latter prioritizes developing robust, efficient, and reliable software with specific goals, exploratory and expository programming emphasize discovery, learning, and communication, rather than solely creating a functioning product or system.

(1) Examples of exploratory programming

- Investigating different machine learning models: A data scientist might experiment with various machine learning models and techniques to find the best approach for a given problem. They might use exploratory programming to test different model configurations, preprocessing steps, and feature selection methods to optimize their solution.

- Designing a new user interface: A user experience designer might use exploratory programming to prototype and test different user interface elements, layouts, and interactions. By quickly iterating through various designs, they can identify the most effective and user-friendly solution for their application.

- Studying the behavior of a complex system: A researcher might use exploratory programming to simulate and analyze the behavior of a complex system, such as a neural network or an economic model. By adjusting the parameters of the model and observing the resulting behavior, they can gain insights into the underlying principles and relationships within the system.

(2) Examples of expository programming 

- Illustrating the principles of physics: An educator might create an expository program to demonstrate the concepts of mechanics, such as force, acceleration, or momentum. The program could simulate the motion of objects under various forces, helping students visualize and understand how these principles apply to real-world situations.

- Visualizing chemical reactions: A chemistry teacher might use expository programming to demonstrate the process of chemical reactions, such as the formation of molecules or the interaction between different elements. The program could present a visual representation of the reaction process, showing how atoms and molecules combine or break apart, helping students gain a better understanding of the underlying principles.

- Explaining biological processes: A biology instructor might develop an expository program to illustrate complex biological processes, such as cellular respiration or DNA replication. The program could provide interactive visualizations of these processes, allowing students to explore and understand the intricate details of how cells function and maintain life.

Exploratory Programming in Mech
---------------------------------

(1) Dataflow Programming Model

The dataflow programming model used in Mech offers flexibility and ease of exploration by allowing developers to define how data flows through a system. This approach emphasizes the relationships between data inputs, processes, and outputs, making it easier to understand and experiment with a program's behavior.

Dataflow programming enables rapid iteration and experimentation, as changes to a program can be made and their effects observed in real-time. This allows developers to quickly test hypotheses, refine their designs, and adapt their programs based on immediate feedback.

(2) Mech Cores

Mech cores are designed with a modular and distributed architecture, allowing developers to create and deploy Mech programs across various environments. This design promotes collaboration, scalability, and adaptability, making it easier to experiment with different configurations and combinations of cores.

Mech cores are scalable and adaptable, enabling the efficient deployment and management of Mech programs in a range of environments, from small-scale local systems to large distributed networks. This flexibility supports the exploration and experimentation of various deployment scenarios.

(3) Integrated Database

The integrated database within Mech cores manages transactions for updates and rewinding, ensuring data consistency and reliability. This feature enables developers to efficiently handle data updates and maintain a consistent state, even as they experiment with different program configurations.

The transaction management provided by the integrated database also supports rewinding and debugging, allowing developers to trace the history of data changes and explore different scenarios. This capability facilitates a deeper understanding of program behavior and helps identify potential issues or improvements.

(4) Real-time Feedback

Mech provides real-time feedback by allowing developers to visualize the results of their programs immediately. This feature enables a more intuitive understanding of how changes in the code affect the output, promoting rapid iteration and a more interactive development process.

The real-time feedback provided by Mech also supports responsive system adjustments, as developers can quickly identify and respond to changes in data or program behavior. This capability allows for faster adaptation and refinement of programs, further enhancing the exploratory and expository programming experience.


Expository Programming
------------------------

(1) Readable Syntax

Mech's readable syntax emphasizes clarity and simplicity, making it easier for developers to understand and explain code. This focus on readability fosters effective communication of complex ideas and promotes a more accessible learning experience.

The clear and concise syntax of Mech promotes self-documenting code, where the intent of the program is evident from its structure and layout. This feature enables developers to create code that is easy to understand, maintain, and explain to others.

(2) Mech Blocks

Mech blocks serve as composable building blocks for creating programs. These blocks can be easily combined, modified, or reused to develop new functionality, facilitating the creation of illustrative examples and demonstrations that effectively convey complex concepts.

Each Mech block encapsulates specific functionality, promoting a modular design that simplifies the understanding and explanation of a program's behavior. This structure allows developers to focus on individual components and their interactions, rather than being overwhelmed by complex monolithic code.

(3) Reactive Dataflow

Mech's reactive dataflow model ensures that updates and changes to data are automatically propagated throughout the system. This feature enables the creation of live examples and demonstrations that dynamically respond to changes, providing a more engaging and interactive learning experience.

With reactive dataflow, Mech enables developers to create live examples and demonstrations that showcase the behavior of a program in real-time. This approach allows learners to experiment with code and observe the effects of their changes instantly, fostering a deeper understanding of the concepts being explained.

(4) Integration with Documentation

Mech's design encourages the integration of code with documentation, making it possible to create interactive explanations that combine text, code, and visualizations. This approach promotes a more immersive and engaging learning experience, helping learners better grasp complex concepts.

Mech allows developers to easily embed code examples within documentation or other learning resources, providing contextually relevant examples that can be interacted with and explored. This feature enables learners to gain hands-on experience and develop a practical understanding of the topics being taught.
